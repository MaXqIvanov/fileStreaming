Hello everyone, my name is Shen Yingchen

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.966
I work in real estate

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.833
I am very happy that I visited the booth of

00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.000
DreamFlat

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.533
at CityScape Global

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.033
because using this program

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.066
you can create

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:14.500
renders and 3D tours

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
even without special skills

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.400
You start to create

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.200
design from scratch

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.966
initially, there is only

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.466
a concrete floor

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.733
and then you can create

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.433
your unique

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
home interior according to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.500
your idea

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.866
In addition, the program supports VR

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.566
and with the necessary equipment

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.700
you will be able to see

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.066
the rooms in virtual reality mode

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.066
I think it's a very convenient

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.400
program for creating

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.566
interior design

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.666
and I recommend to designers

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.966
to try it

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.000
The subscription is not expensive

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.033
it is only

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.433
for 9 or 29 dollars

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.100
Therefore, in my opinion,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.300
this is a very useful solution

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.866
You can also add

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.166
decorative elements, such as lamps

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.233
carpets and other home items

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.633
It doesn't matter if you are

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.100
a designer

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900
or a regular user

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.766
this program will suit you

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.700
Therefore, I recommend

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.666
to try DreamFlat

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.600
Thank you!
